    <p>In 1878, a young traveller by the name of Matteo Romano was scouting for a shorter pass so that his family could safely trek through the rocky mountains.  As he made his way through the snow he came upon a small creek. Thinking that if he followed the creek, it would lead him to an easier break in the dangerous land.  He stopped to refill his canteen when he noticed that the water was warm, nearly hot to the touch.  Way up there, in the coldest of temperatures, a hot spring creek carved through it.  This inspired him to settle his family here, for no fear of dehydration.  Matteo, with the help of his great grandmothers recipes, used the steamy watered creek to create some of his home countries greatest dishes.  Here at Fire Creek Pizzeria, we import the very same water that Matteo used from the heated creek and apply Matteo's own recipes as an ode to the young traveller that founded this wonder.</p>
